Fontstrap
=========

FontStrap is my starting point for making stuff.  It has a bit of PHP but for the most part it is the front end UI and structure I use for prototyping that eventually becomes a web application.  It is Framework independent.

### Why?
Originally I wanted to be able to just drop Bootstrap and Fontawesome into a project.  Actually you can stil do that by just grabbing the /fontstrap folder.  However I figured it makes more sense for me to also have the basic elements and structure that I always use for prototyping a project.

### Frameworks
This ain't no goddamn framework for building a web application.  It is best used for prototyping a design / UI.  However depending on your platform of choice, you should not have too much trouble taking the prototype and putting it into your framework of choice.
