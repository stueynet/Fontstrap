Fontstrap
=========

FontStrap is my starting point for making stuff.  It has a bit of PHP but for the most part it is the front end UI and structure I use for prototyping that eventually becomes a web application.  It is Framework independent.

###Why?
Originally I wanted to be able to just drop Bootstrap and Fontawesome into a project.  Actually you can stil do that by just grabbing the /fontstrap folder.  However I figured it makes more sense for me to also have the basic elements and strcuture that I always use for prototyping a project.
